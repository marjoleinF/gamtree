Changes in Version 0.0.3 (June 2024)

  - Function splinetree added for partitioning unpenalized or parametric spline 
      models.

  - Score-based conditional inference tests can now be used to fit smoothing-spline
      trees. This much reduces computational load. Function gamtree allows to choose
      between use of model-based recursive partitioning (method = "mob") and 
      conditional inference trees (method = "ctree").  
 
  - Although the previous implementation of gamtree was functional, the parameter 
      stability tests were based on the 'wrong' derivatives, leading to
      bad overfitting behavior. The current implementation of gamtree has 
      more limited functionality, but uses proper derivatives for testing 
      stability of smoothing splines. It employs gamm4 to fit the GAMs, which
      provides a full mixed-effects specification of GAMs. It employs merDeriv
      to obtain valid derivatives or scores. The function is now much slower, 
      but should yield accurate subgroups and exhibit much less overfitting.

Changes in Version 0.0.2 (August 2021)

  - Many bug fixes, including: 

  -  Offsets now correctly passed between tree and GAM, which earlier 
       version did not, yielding no changes of improvement when joint 
       estimation was performed.

  - Improved argument passing to functions gam() and bam(). 

  - Function gamtree now supports fitting with gam() and well as bam().

  - Improved plot, coef and predict methods.

Description: Recursively partitions the observations in a dataset, based on the parameters of 
             a generalized additive model (GAM). Function splinetree implements partitioning based
             on parametric or non-penalized spline models. It offers faster computational speed and
             more flexibility for modeling multilevel and longitudinal data. Function gamtree
             implements partitioning based on semi-parametric or penalized spline models, a.k.a. 
             smoothing splines. It requires less user involvement in correctly specifying the
             splines and knots, but has a heavier computational load and offers less flexibility in
             modeling multilevel and longitudinal data. Packages mgcv and splines are used for 
             spline and model estimation, packages partykit and merDeriv are used for partitioning
             and derivative computations.

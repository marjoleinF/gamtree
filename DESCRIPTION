Description: Recursively partitions the observations in a dataset, based on the parameters of a locally
	specified generalized additive model (GAM), while possibly also estimating globally specified GAM 
	terms. Uses package mgcv for fitting smooth and parametetric terms, used function package partykit 
	for recursive partitioning.
